# sample-code
sample code files from different projects during my PhD

Parts of the code developed to analyse and correlate large-scale spectral data for PhD needs. It defines how the "spectrum" object is composed of "peaks", how to automatically detect peaks in a spectrum for further analysis (there is then a list of models available to fit each spectrum and extract relevant parameters)
It is all part of a package entitled "SpectrAnalysis".
